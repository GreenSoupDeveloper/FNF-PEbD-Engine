# FNF-PEbD Engine (Psych Engine but Diferent Engine)


a new modification of Psych Engine for make better mods of fnf!.

The Discord Server!: https://discord.gg/VH2Ng3BTsJ

## Installation:


You must have the most up-to-date version of Haxe, seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

If you get an error about StatePointer when using Lua, run haxelib remove linc_luajit into Command Prompt/PowerShell, then re-install linc_luajit.

If you want video support on your mod, simply do haxelib install hxCodec on a Command prompt/PowerShell
