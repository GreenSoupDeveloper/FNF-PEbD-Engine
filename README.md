# FNF-PEbD Engine (Psych Engine but Diferent Engine)


a new modification of Psych Engine for make better mods of fnf!.

The Discord Server!: https://discord.gg/VH2Ng3BTsJ

## Installation:


You must have the most up-to-date version of Haxe, seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

If you get an error about StatePointer when using Lua, run haxelib remove linc_luajit into Command Prompt/PowerShell, then re-install linc_luajit.

If you want video support on your mod, simply do haxelib install hxCodec on a Command prompt/PowerShell

Conceptual Art:
![conceptualartlink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109924369/185999819-e5246ec4-94cd-4e37-b5a7-6d7098034658.png)

(its a conceptual art cuz idk how to create a fucking FlxUITabMenu)

### InGame Save file function:

This is very usefull if you want some things enabled or disabled in something, for example, the options, you want to have the link function enabled, but you need the src to have it enabled in default, so, the InGame Save file function creates a save file in the game itself, with all the things in the configuration who do you want or idk. (idk how to explain good this function but ye.)

### InGame Update (yeah like yoshicrafter engine)

soon
